# Website Rules

Here are the rules for those who have Write Access to the AspectOS/aspectos.github.io Repository (Including but not limited to the "Website Developers" Github Team) must follow the following rules and failure to comply with them will result to removal of Write Access and/or A Strike. For the sake of simplicity a User (Includes but not limited to Github and Scratch Accounts) with Write Access to the AspectOS/aspectos.github.io Repository will be referred to as a "Website Developer".

## Committing Changes

As a "Website Developer" you cannot Commit changes

- The change fixes a bug and the fix is tested either through a Self Hosted Github Page or locally or/and
- The change has 4 Votes from Members of the "Website Developers" Github Team (See "Merging Pull Requests")

## Merging Pull Requests

Pull Requests must be merged through the "Squash and Merge" method (found in the Dropdown on the Merge Button found on the page of a Mergable Pull Request) and must follow the "Intelligent Naming" system (see "Naming"). You (a "Website Developer") can only Merge a Pull Request if it has 4 votes from "Website Developers".

## Intelligent Naming

Commits and Pull Requests must use the following Naming System. A name must start with the scope of the change in question. Options for it include (but not limited to) meta, bugfix, appearance, docs, tools, pages and features. It must also be inside square brackets ([ and ] ). After the "scope" text the Title should contain a Brief Summary of the Changes with less than 55 words. An example of a title using this Naming System is "[meta] Changed title of About page (#43)". In this case #44 refers to an Issue that the error was reported.
